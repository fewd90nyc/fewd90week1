		<h2>RESUME</h2>

		<p>
			After years as a former spy and a semi-successful pop singer, I'm attempting to try my hand at web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've decided to take a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly to help me build a foundation in web technologies.
		</p>

		<p>
		In my spare time I enjoy:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reading</li>
			<li>Singing</li>
			<li>Doing the Fox Trot</li>
		</ul>
