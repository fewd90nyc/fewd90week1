<h3>about</h3>
<p>My name is An and I like ugly fonts and gaudy web colors.</p>

<p>I was born in a town near Philadelphia and grew up in a small town in southern Maryland. I've lived in New York for (or more than? I can't remember) 6 years. I still feel like a sad teenager most of the time. I take this as a good thing rather than a negative. This vertical line character > | makes me happy.</p>

<p>Once someone asked me how long I'd lived in the U.S. It's been 24 years, 6 months, and 2 days (ending June 28th).</p>
