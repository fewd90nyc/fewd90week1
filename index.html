	<h2>New York</h2>
	<p>In 2015, I made the move everyone dreams about and came to New York. Currently, I'm an Digital Account Manager for a Media Agency called Zero-In. I specialize in content development, strategy, and project management. I work side by side with International companies and agencies such as: The UN, Equinox, Crunch, Discover, Shake Shack, Melt-shop, Little Beet and more!<br />
    <br />
    I'm also heavily involed in  projects around my community. I attend regular community board meetings, volunteer for the municipality (teacher with Junior Achievement of New York) and am currently, helping a friend in her District Committee Woman campaign. </p>

	<h2>Montreal</h2>
  	<p>In 2013, I graduated McGill University with Bachelor's of Music with a focus in percussion. I also achieved a concentration in German, a minor in Marketing, along with a penchant for French language. After graduation, I pursued multiple careers includeing: studio musican, video game social media expert, and lastly a junior for a international classical music agency.</p>

  	<h2>Baltimore</h2>
  	<p>Even-though I live a few hours away, I still feel a connection to my child-hood home, Baltimore. It was there where I received a great high-school education, and served my community through various fundraising events. Later in 2014, I would move back to Baltimore to begin studying for the GREs so that I may go to business school. During my time there, I worked at Bill's Music as an E-marketer, and volunteered with the Baltimore Bike Party in multiple capacities.</p>
