	<h1>Hi I'm Dustin Hood</h1>

	<p>I was born in the mountains of West Virginia and raised in the forests of New Jersey.</p> <p>Trekked to Ohio as a teen and settled toward the center to grow.</p> 
	<p>Education and Dreams in hand, New York's gravity drew me in to expand.</p>
	___

	<p>Peanut butter, turkey sandwiches, and pizza will get you far.</p>
	___

	<p>I've always been a risk taker.</p> <p>Brand personalities and creating distinct brand personas are my specialty.</p> <p>Giving business a personality / persona is my goal. Creating a feeling people can connect with, making people nostalgic for a brand.</p>
	___   

	<p>Remember to be a human. We all strive for similar things in different places.</p>
